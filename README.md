## Settings
You can disable the auto-generation of the layer list by editing the file [TagsAndLayersGenerator](https://github.com/nicoplv/smart-tags-and-layers/blob/master/Assets/Extensions/SmartTagsAndLayers/Editor/TagsAndLayersGenerator.cs) like that:
```C#
private static bool autoGenerate = false;
```

You can change the folder path of the generated list by editing the file [TagsAndLayersGenerator](https://github.com/nicoplv/smart-tags-and-layers/blob/master/Assets/Extensions/SmartTagsAndLayers/Editor/TagsAndLayersGenerator.cs) like that:
```C#
private static string scriptFolderPathAbsolute = Application.dataPath + "YourPath";
```
